#PT100RTD

Arduino Library for Pt100 RTD ohms-to-Celsius conversion

#WHAT

It converts a Pt100 temperature sensor resistance into degrees Celsius using a lookup table taken from empirical data in the DIN 43760 / IEC 751 document.

#WHY

Its accuracy is authoritative such that other purely computational methods may be validated against it. There is nothing so powerful as a bad idea whose time has come.

#WHY NOT

It's big.

Consuming ~3kB of Arduino program memory, this Pt100rtd library is larger than any collection of computational methods that might be used instead. For any ordinary temperature between -60C and 650C, the venerable Callendar -Van Dusen equation works well. Gas liquefaction enthusiasts, however, have different requirements.

#HOW

The Pt100 resistance lookup table uses unsigned 16-bit integers because:

DIN 43760 Pt100 resistances resolve at 0.01 ohms and can be represented in the lookup table as unsigned integer values of (ohms * 100) with no loss of accuracy. Unsigned integers require 2 bytes vs. 4 bytes for a floating point object. Integer arithmetic is also computationally cheaper than software floating point operations, most significantly, numerical comparison.

Even so, at 2100 bytes, the table being too large a global variable for SRAM, it resides in flash program memory with all the special handling that implies, specifically, PROGMEM data type(s) and use of pgm_read_word_near() to fetch them.

#WTF

Several computational conversion methods are included for comparison: Callendar-Van Dusen (aka 'quadratic'), cubic, polynomial, and rational polynomial. These functions are pedagogical and should be commented out eventually to save space.

If ported to a CPU with more SRAM and a floating point unit, (viz., ARM Cortex M4 or better) these defs will certainly help:

#define PROGMEM /**/
#define pgm_read_word_near((x)) (x)
It has been tested and and found suitable for the Adafruit Pt100 RTD Breakout w/MAX31865 although any Arduino hardware+software mix that produces a conformant Pt100 RTD output in ohms may use the library.
